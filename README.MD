This is an in-progress 3D character creation suite for Godot 4.x (tested on 4.1).

Currently, only female is available.

Contributors are welcome.

# Basic How-to:
The project contains two folders, one for the godot projct and a Source folder containing the blender files and textures.


# TODO / Roadmap:

- Redo all the blendshapes to make them more realistic (contributors needed for this)
- Add some basic clothing? might be out of scope but a rudimentary clothing or equipment system might be useful.
- Add more hairstyles (and fix the hair physics, it looks wierd right now)
- Add male gender
- Improve the aging texture
